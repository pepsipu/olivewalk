currently, the food for the cds meal plan are published on sheets.

this week: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xZWXd0J-6D3dclTkZSGBs4--kXtRSZQOuSsm9ZSPodg/edit?gid=0#gid=0
next week: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wqkE3CPngibKf2IYf_9lnpGiV_3Hp9mLZvUE43osDa8/edit?gid=0#gid=0

ideally we could just fetch the export of this sheet as a csv, but cds only provides view access, not export access. so we kind of need to go through the sheets api
