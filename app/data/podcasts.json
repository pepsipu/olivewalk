How do we address climate change if the political system fails to act? Has the logic of markets infiltrated too many aspects of our lives? What is the future of the Republican Party? What do psychedelics teach us about consciousness? What does sci-fi understand about our present that we miss? Can our food system be just to humans and animals alike?\n\nUnlock full access to New York Times podcasts and explore everything from politics to pop culture.

Then Stu Burguiere, host of BlazeTV's \"Stu Does America,\" joins to discuss how President Trump’s tariff threats to Mexico and Canada are really a negotiation tactic, how he's already getting positive results without the tariffs taking effect, how the corporate media is shaping the narrative incorrectly, the DNC leadership conference’s most embarrassing moments, how Democrats have clearly learned nothing, why identity politics are still not working for them, Kanye West and his \"wife\" Bianca Censori’s obscene nudity on the red carpet at the Grammys, Alicia Keys pushing DEI on stage during her speech, and more. Then U.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville joins to discuss the \"Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act\" passing in the House but being held up in the GOP-controlled Senate, what's stopping the bill from being voted on, the disturbing reality about the issue, and more.\nGrenell- https://x.com/RichardGrenell\nBurguiere- https://www.youtube.com/StuDoesAmerica\nTuberville- https://www.tuberville.senate.gov/\n\nHungryroot: https://Hungryroot.com/MK | Get 40% off your first box PLUS a free item in every box for life! \nLumen: Visit https://lumen.me/MEGYN for 20% Off\nKars 4 Kids: Donate online today at https://Kars4Kids.org/MK\nXX-XY Athletics: Go to https://TheTruthFits.com | Code MK20",

Not the way they do when you’ve slept in a funny position, but as if the tendons in her forearms and hands were moving through mud. What felt like sharp electric shocks kept sparking in her fingers and sometimes up the inside of her biceps and across her chest. Holding anything was excruciating: a cup, a toothbrush, her phone. Even doing nothing was miserable. It hurt when she sat with her hands in her lap, when she stood, when she lay flat on the bed or on her side. The slightest pressure — a bedsheet, a watch band, a bra strap — was intolerable.\n\nOur understanding of pain, and especially chronic pain, is far behind where it should be. We don’t know what causes a person with an injury to develop chronic pain, or why it happens in some people and not others, or why it happens more often in women. At a genetic and cellular level, we don’t know which systems get out of whack, or why, or how to fix them.",

                                "standard": "At the time of his appearance on The Dating Game in 1978, Alcala was a convicted sexual predator who had served time for sexual assault and had only avoided a charge of attempted murder on a technicality. After his arrest, investigators would learn that, by the time he appeared on the game show, he was also a killer. In the year that followed, Alcala would go on to murder several other women until he was finally caught and convicted for his crimes. At his trial, Rodney Alcala was found guilty of eight murders, among other crimes, but he is suspected of several other murders, perhaps as many as one hundred or more.\n\nThank you to the Incredible Dave White of Bring Me the Axe Podcast for research and Writing support!\n\nReferences\n\nAssociated Press. 1980. \"Forest worker tells of grisly body find, fingers defendent .\" Daily Breeze (Torrence, CA), March 23: 7.\n\n—. 1980. \"Witness in Alcala trial admits lying.\" Los Angeles Times, March 26: 44.\n\n—. 1980. \"Jury deliberate murder charge.\" Oakland Tribune, April 30: E3.\n\nBrown, Doug. 1980. \"Jury asks for the death penalty.\" Los Angeles Times, May 9: 32.\n\n—. 1980. \"Prosecution rests case in penalty part of Alcala trial.\" Los Angeles Times, May 8: 63.\n\nCBS News. 2024. \"Rodney Alcala: The Killing Game.\" 48 Hours . \n\nDunn, Edward. 1977. \"Oneida woman slain in L.A.\" Post-Standard (Syracuse, NY), November 15: 1.\n\nEsquivel, Paloma. 2010. \"Alcala gets death penalty.\" Los Angeles Times, March 10: 72.\n\nFalcon, Gabriel. 2010.

Award-winning CBS News correspondents thoughtfully examine the complexities of each crime by transporting you to the heart of the investigation through key evidence and gripping interviews with critical figures from the case. The unmatched reporting has made a tangible difference in countless lives, leading to the exoneration of wrongly convicted individuals and the reopening — and resolution — of previously closed cold cases.\nListen to a new “48 Hours” episode every Monday and then go deeper into the case on Tuesdays with the immersive “Post Mortem” series — producers and correspondents join host Anne-Marie Green to discuss key evidence, dead ends, mishaps, and stranger-than-fiction twists they faced in the field. Plus, every Thursday, we’ll revisit a classic “48 Hours” episode. \nGet ad free access to \"48 Hours\" podcasts by subscribing to 48 Hours+ on Apple Podcasts: https://apple.co/4aEgENo."

Then, he’s joined by Will Cain to gain a fan's perspective of the Luka trade and discuss the differences between ESPN and Fox News (16:02). Next, Ryen shares his thoughts on De’Aaron Fox being traded to the Spurs before Ceruti joins to determine which teams wouldn’t have been interested in trading with Dallas (51:38). Next, Jovan Buha explains how the Luka deal materialized, what this means for LeBron’s future, and whether the Lakers will make any more moves before the trade deadline (69:44). Finally, Life Advice with Ceruti and Kyle (96:40)!

The first episode launched January 1st, 2014 and feature stories of murder, abduction, rape, and even more bizarre forms of crime. It’s the purest form of true-crime where the raw uncensored audio tells the story. Everything from 911 calls to court testimony, interviews with victims and sometimes with perpetrators give listeners a 360 degree look at the seedy underbelly of human nature and so-called civilized society. Told from an everyman's point of view, Sword and Scale goes beyond the news clips and the sensationalist headlines to hold up a mirror to the audience and ask, \"Is it us versus them? Or are we just like 'them' too?\" Sword and scale proves that the worst monsters are real."

James joins the Armchair Expert to discuss paying the price for such a dominant chin, the reality of being an Oklahoman in Los Angeles, and still feeling like every job is his last job. James and Dax talk about the story of meeting after Dax lost a role to James, sharing an enduring appreciation for mens’ bodies, and comparing notes on starring in shows that trick people. James explains that being a middle child is the sweet spot of siblingry, learning that he was the subject of a Corny Collins fantasy, and how acting in Jury Duty really was the tight rope of all tight ropes.\n\nFollow Armchair Expert on the Wondery App or wherever you get your podcasts.

I am endlessly fascinated by the messiness of being human, and I find people who are vulnerable and honest about their struggles and shortcomings to be incredibly sexy. I invite you to join me as I explore other people’s stories. We will celebrate, above all, the challenges and setbacks that ultimately lead to growth and betterment. What qualifies me for such an endeavor? More than a decade of sobriety, a degree in Anthropology and four years of improv training. I will attempt to discover human “truths” without any laboratory work, clinical trials or data collection. I will be, in the great tradition of 16th-century scientists, an Armchair Expert.\nFollow Armchair Expert on the Wondery App or wherever you get your podcasts.
